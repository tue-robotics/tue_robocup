""" This challenge is described in the RoboCup@Home 2019 rulebook, around page 48.

Main goal
Upon entrance, the robot asks the operator which room shall be cleaned. All misplaced known objects
found in this room must be taken to their predefined locations and unknown objects thrown in the trash bin.

Number of objects: 5..10

Time limit: 5 minutes

Objects can be anywhere, including the floor, seats, and on furniture. All objects are visible from
at least 1.0 m distance (no occlusions) and have the following distributions:

Known objects: Any two regular and two alike objects

Unknown objects: One unknown object at grasping distance (i.e. no decorations)

Reward: 1000 pts (100 pts per object),
Bonus: max 500 pts

In this implementation object recognition is only partly used, and the floor is not scanned for objects.
Small and/or large objects are not used.
After grasping an object the operator is asked to state the category of the object so the robot knows
from the local knowledge where to place the object.
If the operator states 'Trash' as the category the object will be placed in the trash_bin.
