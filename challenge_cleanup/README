== TEST THE EXECUTIVE ==

TIP of the day: use 

    rostopic pub /pocketsphinx/output std_msgs/String 'livingroom' --once; rostopic pub /pocketsphinx/output std_msgs/String '!!str yes' --once

to test the executive.


== WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK? ==

The clean-up challenge depends on some knowledge. 

First of all, the knowledbe base (KB) must know where every type/class of object should be cleaned up to. This is done via the 'storage_class'-predicate. For example: 

    'storage_class(can, trashbin)'.

states that something of the can class should be stored at something of the class 'trashbin'.

The fact that some object objXXX in the worldmodel is an instance of class is asserted to the worldmodel via perception. It can be queried via the 'instance_of'-predicate.
Classes of objects can also be subclasses of another class, so you can state 'storage_class' for a general class like 'stuff': 'storage_class(stuff, desk)', and also state that, say, a 'rubiks'-cube is a subclass of 'stuff'. This way, the reasoner deduces that the 'storage_class' of 'rubiks' is 'desk'. 

Furthermore, the KB also needs to hold information on which drop-off locations can be used. For example:

    dropoff_point(robotics_testlab_A, _, trashbin, point_3d(6.22,   0.78,   0.8)).

states that the drop-off location 'trashbin' has point (6.22, 0.78, 0.8) (in the robotics_testlab_A environment). The 3rd argument ('trashbin' in this case) should correspond to the 2nd argument of the storage_class/2 facts.

The clean-up challenge python file defines all of its queries near the top of the file.
