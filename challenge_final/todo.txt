  GUI: handle click events (Sjoerd)
  GUI: handle SetType service calls (Sjoerd)
  PER: fit 3D models and add to ED (Sjoerd)
  DONE EXC: Find a way to check whether we found some object (i.e. has the right label). Without the reasoner! DONE: Ed offers a type-parameter
  EXC: Ask the user an item and position (this is a piece of furniture, for example): Erik is bezig
  EXC: Pre-empt driving when the postion of the desired object, like table, is known. Maybe use smach.Concurrence
  EXC: While driving, look at the clusters TFs one by ones
  ED_: query.center_point should be a pointstamped instead of a bare point assumed to be in /map. Make this explicit, so we can also explore relative to /maigo/base_link

== TODO CATEGORIES ==

    GUI: web gui server
    EXC: executive
    PER: perception / model fitting
    ED_: Ed and its API
