=== TEST ===
  
  GUI: handle SetType service calls (Sjoerd)

  GUI: handle click events (Sjoerd)
       - Detect which objects is clicked

  PER: fit 3D models and add to ED (Sjoerd)

=== BACKLOG ===

  EXC: check statemachine (Sjoerd)
  GUI: remember id clicked on. Give back only this measurement in GetMeasurement. Use this id for SetLabel (Sjoerd)
  ED:  ddp: extractPointCloud: image masks contain holes if scale_factor > 1. Fix this (Sjoerd)
  EXC: Ask the user an item and position (this is a piece of furniture, for example): Erik is bezig
  EXC: Pre-empt driving when the postion of the desired object, like table, is known. Maybe use smach.Concurrence

  GUI: Fix long service calls
  ED:  Fix heavy memory usage (Sjoerd)
  ED_: query.center_point should be a pointstamped instead of a bare point assumed to be in /map. Make this explicit, so we can also explore relative to /maigo/base_link

=== DONE ===
  
  GUI: Highlight the clicked object.
  EXC: Move to some object after we labeled it.
  EXC: Ask ED for command using GetGUICommand (Loy)
       service: /ed/gui/get_gui_command

    GUI: web gui server
    EXC: executive
    PER: perception / model fitting
    ED_: Ed and its API
