============

Robot_skills provide interfaces to all parts of a robot: its base, arms, head, perception, worldmodel, speech system, etc. 
The package also provides a console for a robot, so you can give the robot commands like goto(<some coordinate>) via a console

A robot is represented via a robot-object which can be used by the [https://github.com/tue-robotics/robot_smach_states](robot_smach_states)-package
