                (lights should become green -> say 'continue')

    rosrun challenge_open open_challenge_rwc2013.py (if this keeps waiting for a transform, please restart)

Sentences:
    objects:
       coke
       seven_up

Plan:
  Ask where to place the objects, first search for closest object make sure that this is NOT
  the object that we are looking for!
  Steps:
    - Ask object
    - Scan tables
    - Get locations -> goto
    - First locate "wrong" object
    - Then locate correct object
    - Grasp and bring to person
    - Now we know the location of the correct object, 
      grasp and bring to person
    - Finished!
