INSTRUCTIONS:
STEP 1: Guiding:  Guide the robot while other people are walking around you. also let other people walk between you (the guide) and the robot.
STEP 2: Elevator: Guide the robot into the elevator and say amigo leave. confirm with yes and check if amigo turns around and leaves the elevator and calls for you.
STEP 3: Crowd:    Walk through a crowd and position yourself about one meter behind the crowd. Amigo should now go around the crowd and find you again.

Furthermore:
- If AMIGO lost the operator it will turn purple. It expects the operator to come stand in front of him.
