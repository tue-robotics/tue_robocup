### STARTUP:

amigo1:
    2. amiddle


### HOW TO TEST:

Run speech generator to get several sentences that amigo should be able to hear:
    3. rosrun challenge_gpsr generate_random_sentence.py

This file can be re-executed to get new sentence.
Sentences can sometimes be unclear or not logic. Please mention in test report.

Then run on the same amigo pc:
    4. rosrun challenge_gpsr gpsr.py amigo

The robot will say "What can I do for you?" and then you can say your sentence.

!!! Please mention in your test results how many times amigo was able to understand you !!!
