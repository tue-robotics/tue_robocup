    Once a door is no longer locked, the lever is not latched into locking plate, it can be pushed open.
    This can be done either with the arms or even with the base, if you push gently,
        as a person would use his/her butt to bump open a door when you're holding something with both hands :-)

    Assumptions: We are already in front of the door, e.g. on the door mat so to speak.

    To do this, the following steps are needed:
     - Move slowly to put the edge of the base against the door
     - Now move forward, perpendicular to the wall the door is in.
