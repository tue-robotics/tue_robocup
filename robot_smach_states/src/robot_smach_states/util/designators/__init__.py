"""
Designators are intended to encapsulate the process of resolving values needed
at runtime based on write-time definitions.  This sound very vague, but
imagine a navigation task that needs to navigate to some object.

The objects you want to navigate to is not yet known beforehand, because its not yet present.
Instead, you can define some function that finds an object to navigate to.

A designator is an object that encapsulates such a function.
The only interface method is that they have a resolve function that gives some value.

How .resolve() does its work is not important here and
    may be a custom implementation for all instances.

The library here defines a couple of standard designators:
- Designator:           simply returns a predefined value that defaults to None
- VariableDesignator:   any user of this designator can set the designators value and
                        can be used to pass around data.
- AttrDesignator:       Some designator types wrap other designators, like AttrDesignator.
                        It returns some attribute of of whatever the wrapped designator resolved to
- FuncDesignator:       Apply a function to the resolution of another, wrapped, designator
