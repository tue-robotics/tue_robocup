    say test  
        (to test speaker is working) 

    rosrun challenge_atomic_actions challenge_basic_functionalities.py


== TEST THE EXECUTIVE ==
- All basic functionalities will be tested one after another. For most cases, the robot returns to 0,0,0 to start the next part
- Put some objects on the second table (i.e., without the computer) for the pick-and-place demo.
- Make sure the thrashbin is placed correctly
- Testing avoid that is a bit difficult, since there is no space for detours in our testlab
- Current questions for what did you say:
"--- What is the capital of Germany? -------------"
"--- What is the heaviest animal in the world?----"
"--- Who is the president of America?-------------"
"--- Who is your example?-------------------------"
"--- When do the olympics start?------------------"
"--- Which football club is the best?-------------"
"--- Who is the best looking person around here?--"
"--- Which person is not able to say yes?---------"
"--- Which town has been bombed?------------------"
"--- What is your motto?--------------------------"

It is possible to start the challenge at one of the other atomic actions. To this end, give an argument:
Pick and place: 	rosrun challenge_atomic_actions challenge_basic_functionalities.py 1
Avoid that:			rosrun challenge_atomic_actions challenge_basic_functionalities.py 2
What did you say?:	rosrun challenge_atomic_actions challenge_basic_functionalities.py 3
Before doing so, please make sure the robot is reset (arms, spindle, head) and is localized correctly

== OBSOLETE ==
- Put some objects on the cabinet expedit for the fetch and carry
- Try to be at least with two people for the find me and go over there
